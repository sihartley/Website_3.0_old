            <h4>Quality Materials.</h4>
            <p>We only use the highest quality vinyl films from 3M, Avery, and Oracal, as well as others, for all our graphics products. We offer Premium Cast (Wet-Install) and Premium Wrap (Dry-Install) materials. So, whatever your chosen installation method, we produce graphics to suit your needs. We do not offer graphics made with calendared materials, often referred to as intermediate or economy vinyl films, even if requested. We only use materials equal to or above these specifications: 3M 7125, 3M 2080, Avery SC950, Avery SW900, Oracal 751, and Oracal 970RA.</p>
