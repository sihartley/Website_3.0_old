            <h3>Quality Materials</h3>
            <p>Over the years, we have gathered a selection of the highest-quality vinyl films. We offer choices from 3M, Avery, Oracal, and others. Different materials suit different installation methods, so we offer Premium Cast for wet-install and Premium Wrap for dry-install. We do not offer graphics made with calendared materials (i.e., intermediate or economy vinyl films), even if requested.<br>
            We only use materials equal to or above these specifications:
                <a href="/pages/color-charts/3m-color-charts.php#7125-cast">3M 7125</a>,
                <a href="/pages/color-charts/3m-color-charts.php#2080-wrap">3M 2080</a>,
                <a href="/pages/color-charts/avery-color-charts.php#SC950-cast">Avery SC950</a>,
